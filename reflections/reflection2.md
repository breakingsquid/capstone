## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

    * The random wheel generator can generate a meal!
    * Adding a comment section to recipes
    * Generating a profile for user

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

    * Working with UPDATE sql to only change sections that are not null
    * Connecting backend with frontend in wheel, and managing middleware tasks.
    * Managing merging, especially at the end.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

    * We managed to complete most of our core features and some of the main functionalities of stretch features (comment section, profile page). We did not complete some tasks such as customized time of day and displaying all recipes since they were not as significant as the other ones we worked on

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

    * Mentors were great in aiding us with the next steps to take.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

    * Currently, save a meal plan is at "low risk" because generating a meal at all from the wheel was the focus for this sprint.
