## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

    * Reached out to Spoonacular API and requested student access for us to cache data
    * After feedback and advice from Obi, we were able to design a recipe card that displayed things more clearly
    * Linking the backend and frontend with displaying recipes and saving/deleting recipes

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

    * Uncertainty with how we were going to keep data on our database, either storing in local database or making frequent api calls
    * Dealing with merge conflicts when merging pull requests
    * Determining how we should store categories in our recipes table, with a possible solution of using bit masking

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We managed to finish most of all tasks for Sprint 1. Then wheel is a work in progress since this component was dependent on our API which we ran into some issues with. We had to pivot from original plans with how we would be storing our recipes into categories. We also worked on some tasks from Sprint 2, so we will need to do some rebalancing. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The Github project board was useful in helping us plan out our tasks and store our finished tasks. Figma was particularly useful in planning out the designs for our project, since we could always reference back to it. Stack overflow was also a good resource to turn to for problems with bugs/errors. Our mentors were also really helpful in pointing our potential problems with our current API approach, as well as giving insight on how descriptive our issues should be.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Our wheek component is 'low-risk' because it is a bit behind schedule, but it should be picking up speed. The community component is considered one of our stretch features and we would just not include it should deadlines be close.
