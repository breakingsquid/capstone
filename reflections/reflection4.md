## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

    * We deployed our website with Heroku in time for the bug bash
    * Decided on a color scheme/design for our website
    * Storing instructions in our db to not rely on API
    * Display Meal Plan on Saved page

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

    * Deploying our website (initially).
    * Unsaving a meal plan
    * Getting some text to appear on screen because of class naming issues (using same class name for different components).
    * We considered taking the recipe summary away.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

    * We finished the tasks we estimated to be done with at this point, and have been adding issues/features as we go along the sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

    * Our mentors continue to be a great aid in our project development, as well as our instructors for helping us deploy using Heroku.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

    * Testing is at risk, as we have some clean up to do with our CSS and general code still, but we'll attempt to implement some simple tests to at least get some practice with it. We can also talk to mentors or instructors for help with getting started.
