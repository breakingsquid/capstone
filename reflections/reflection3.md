Pod Members: **Maritza Padilla, Andrew Lee, Ann Wang**

## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 * Generate and save a meal plan
 * Saving and fetching profile image uploads through Cloudinary API
 * Community page with comments and styling

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?
 * Handling edge cases on wheel page and making appropriate function calls (ex on click vs on change)
 * Making original flavors appear on the edit page
 * Frontend decisions (colors, libraries, buttons)
 * Selecting recipes to recommend based on time of day (criteria)

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 * We mostly finished our tasks for this sprint, as we were adding more tasks to complete as this week went on. Responsiveness moved to next sprint

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 * Mostly the same as last week, this week was heavy with debugging, so we referred to the aforementioned resources

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 * Styling and design in general, since we still have some concrete decisions to make about our final product and what would make it deployable
