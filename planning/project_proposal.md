# Project Proposal

Pod Members: Maritza Padilla, Ann Wang, Andrew Lee

## Problem Statement

College students struggle to eat healthy due to time constraints by accessing recipes and planning out meals
Target Audience: College students

## Description

To provide a medium where college students can search for recipes that are oriented towards their lifestyle. Fun way to choose a meal for the day based on different criteria (easy meals, breakfast options,...). Option to randomly generate meal list for the day.

## Expected Features List

- Log In/Sign Up Page
- Home Page: Carousel bar with quick meal options that align with time of day.
- Below Home Page: Contains dropdown menu to select from categories. Lists the recipes from the database.
    - Ex: Morning: "Good morning, [Name]" Breakfast
- Recipe Page: Lists Name, Desc, steps
- Sidebar for quicklinks to steps on Recipe page (As seen here: https://learn.freshcap.com/growing/grow-at-home-how-to-grow-mushrooms-at-home-using-straw-logs/).
- 
- My account page with calender
- Home page with dropdown menu to select from categories, and lists the recipes from the database.
- Meal Wheel Help: An option that can be picked from home page, where user spins a wheel to randomize their options
- Another idea: have a calendar where meals that students choose can appear on times they laid out (like a schedule planner but for meals)
- Idea: Saved Meal Section
- Recipe Page: When recipe is clicked, they can scroll through it
